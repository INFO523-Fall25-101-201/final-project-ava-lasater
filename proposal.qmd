description: "This project will analyze data from the U.S. Department of Education’s College Scorecard 
(https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) to explore how institutional and financial factors influence student outcomes 
across U.S. colleges and universities. Specifically, it will investigate the relationship between cost of attendance and 
key outcome metrics such as retention rates and post-graduation earnings. The working hypothesis is that higher tuition 
combined with limited scholarship support is associated with lower student retention due to increased financial strain, 
while institutions with higher tuition may exhibit higher post-graduation earnings due to factors such as institutional 
prestige and resource availability. The financial burden associated with colllege is becoming increasingly heavy for young 
people, and I am very curious to see what the relationship with student outcomes. "

A brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. as well as the reason why you chose this dataset.

Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.

This data contains institution-level data files for 1996-97 through 2022-23 containing aggregate data for each institution. Includes information on 
institutional characteristics, enrollment, student aid, costs, and student outcomes. Field of study-level data files for the pooled 
2014-15, 2015-16 award years through the pooled 2018-19, 2019-20 award years containing data at the credential level and 4-digit 
CIP code combination for each institution. Includes information on cumulative debt at graduation and earnings one year after graduation. Essentially,
this dataset holds a lot of information that can be used to understand student success, university statistics, and demographic information.

Initialy, this dataset contains 3306 columns, and 6430 rows. Since this file is too large to load directly into Github, I am 
working on solutions. Thus, I do have have robust numbers and have yet to clean and throw columns that I am not interested in. I
will be retaining a lot of columns related to the cost of attendance, demographic information, and outcome metrics which indclude 
salary metric, retention percentages, etc.

The main columns I will be considering are outlined below:
-   **INSTNM**: Institution name
-   **STABBR**: 2-letter state abbreviation
-   **HIGHDEG**: Highest degree awarded:
        0 Non-degree-granting
        1 Certificate degree
        2 Associate degree
        3 Bachelor's degree
        4 Graduate degree
-   **PREDEG**: Predominant undergraduate degree awarded:
        0 Not classified
        1 Predominantly certificate-degree granting
        2 Predominantly associate's-degree granting
        3 Predominantly bachelor's-degree granting
        4 Entirely graduate-degree granting
-   **CONTROL**: Control of institution (IPEDS) (i.e. private, public)
-   **COSTT4_A**: Average cost of attendance (academic year institutions)
-   **TUITIONFEE_IN**: In-state tuition and fees
-   **TUITIONFEE_OUT**: Out-of-state tuition and fees
-   **TUITFTE**: Net tuition revenue per full-time equivalent student
-   **C150_4**: Completion rate for first-time, full-time students at four-year institutions (150% of expected time to completion)
-   **C150_4_POOLED**: Completion rate for first-time, full-time students at four-year institutions (150% of expected time to completion), pooled for two year rolling averages
-   **RET_FT4**: First-time, full-time student retention rate at four-year institutions
-   **COMP_ORIG_YR4_RT**: Percent completed within 4 years at original institution
-   **COMP_ORIG_YR6_RT**: Percent completed within 6 years at original institution
-   **RPY_1YR_RT**: Fraction of repayment cohort who are not in default, and with loan balances that have declined one year since entering repayment, excluding enrolled 
        and military deferment from calculation. (Rolling averages)
-   **DEP_INC_AVG**: Average family income of dependent students in real 2015 dollars.
-   **GRAD_DEBT_MDN**: The median debt for students who have completed
-   **COUNT_WNE_P10**: Number of students working and not enrolled 10 years after entry
-   **MD_EARN_WNE_P10**: Median earnings of students working and not enrolled 10 years after entry
-   **COUNT_WNE_INC1_P10**: Number of students working and not enrolled 10 years after entry in the lowest income tercile $0-$30,000
-   **COUNT_WNE_P6**: Mean earnings of students working and not enrolled 6 years after entry
-   **MD_EARN_WNE_P6**: Median earnings of students working and not enrolled 6 years after entry
-   **COUNT_WNE_INC1_P6**: Number of students working and not enrolled 6 years after entry in the lowest income tercile $0-$30,000

I chose this dataset because it allows me to directly link financial inputs (tuition and aid) with student outcomes (retention 
and earnings), helping to uncover whether affordability or institutional prestige has a stronger effect on student success. Additionally, this dataset holds so much
interesting data, and I am interested in a lot of these columns. However, I will need to balance the number of columns I look at and the my main goals for the project.



## Questions

The two questions you want to answer.

1. How does average cost of attendance aid affects student retention rates at institutions with different tuition levels?

2. Is there a relationship between institutional tuition and post-graduation earnings, and does this differ by institution 
type (public, private nonprofit, for-profit)?

## Analysis plan

-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external 
data to be merged in (if any).

To answer the first question, I will be looking at the average net prices and retention. There are multiple columns for each of these
factors in the dataset. Next, there are several breakdowns concerning the percentage of student working after graduation. I will use this 
data and compare the type of institution and the tuition to see if there is a relationship. I plan on doing an EDA and determining which 
factors specifically I want to focus on, then I will perform a linear regression if that makes sense for the data, or other forms of 
quantitative analysis in order to determine a relationship.
