description: "This project will analyze data from the U.S. Department of Education’s College Scorecard 
(https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) to explore how institutional and financial factors influence student outcomes 
across U.S. colleges and universities. Specifically, it will investigate the relationship between tuition costs, 
scholarship or grant aid, and key outcome metrics such as retention rates and post-graduation earnings. The working 
hypothesis is that higher tuition combined with limited scholarship support is associated with lower student retention 
due to increased financial strain, while institutions with higher tuition may exhibit higher post-graduation earnings due 
to factors such as institutional prestige and resource availability. The financial burden associated with colllege is 
becoming increasingly heavy for young people, and I am very curious to see what the relationship with student outcomes. "

A brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. as well as the reason why you chose this dataset.

Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.

I chose this dataset because it allows me to directly link financial inputs (tuition and aid) with student outcomes (retention 
and earnings), helping to uncover whether affordability or institutional prestige has a stronger effect on student success.

## Questions

The two questions you want to answer.

1. How does average grant or scholarship aid affect student retention rates at institutions with different tuition levels?

2. Is there a relationship between institutional tuition and post-graduation earnings, and does this differ by institution 
type (public, private nonprofit, for-profit)?

## Analysis plan

-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).
